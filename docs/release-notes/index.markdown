- Remove search as it causes program layout issues on first run Unfortunately having a search controller in `AllProgramsViewController` was causing our `UISplitViewController` to get into a weird intiial state which was then leading to an overly large navigation bar when pushing `ProgramViewController`. That navigation bar was then occluding the top of the program's `RootView` meaning it wasn't possible to interact with the menu. This change removes search until we can find the issue with our use of `UISplitViewController`. THere's a longer discussion on the issue tracking this: https://github.com/inseven/opolua/issues/206

- TBarInit() is supposed to call gUPDATE OFF
