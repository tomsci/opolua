# Status

The opolua OPL runtime is a reimplementation of the OPL language used by the EPOC Release 5 operating system. This means it differs in behaviour from the original Psion and Psion-compatible systems in some key ways--amongst other things, it implements a much stricter memory model--and some original programs may not run correctly. Right now, the largest omission is the lack of database support (see our [FAQ](/faq/)), but there are also a number of missing opcodes and commands we hope to add support for in the coming months.

This page lists the status of programs we've tested, and any known issues we are tracking. Please feel free to reach out to [support@opolua.org](mailto:support@opolua.org), or raise a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/opolua/issues) if you encounter issues, have updates, or programs you're excited to see supported.
