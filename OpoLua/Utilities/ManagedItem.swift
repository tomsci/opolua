/**
 Utility for managing access to both local and iCloud Drive files.

 Unfortunately, while the Apple documentation says we should use NSMetadataQuery (Sportlight APIs) to watch for changes to the download status of files, these don't actually appear to work for externally accessed APIs (the queries just return empty). This therefore hides away an ugly polling mechanism which--where necessary--kicks of the item download and then watches for its downloading status. There's a tiny silver lining to this approach in that NSMetadataQuery would require us to have iCloud entitlements which shouldn't actually be required for our specific use case.

 If anyone sees this and feels a bit ðŸ¤¢, we're very open to improvement suggestions, or being told how to use NSMetadataQuery correctly.
