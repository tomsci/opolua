            notes: "OPL is a runtime and viewer for files and programs from the 90s-era Psion palmtop computers running the EPOC operating system. It lets users add and browse folders on their phone and view files that are in original EPOC formats. It is intended to let users of these early portable computers access files and data that might be long-forgotten and thought lost. For example, users can view and export image files from those original machines (.mbm), sound files, etc, and scripts they might have written (.opo). The app ships with examples of these files and scripts to help users get started and understand how it works. You can find these in the 'Files' and 'Scripts' sections of the app. Tapping the files you find in these sections should let you explore and exercise the functionality provided. Thanks for the review!"
